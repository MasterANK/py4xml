# ***Introduction to XML***
XML stands for extensible markdown language, An XML file is a file which is used to store data in both computer and human readable. XML is a markup language much like HTML but was designed to store data, transport data and was designed to be self-descriptive. XML is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation while World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an organization whose mission is to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.

## Features XML File
+ XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags
+ XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
+ XML is Extensible as XML applications will work as expected even if new data is added (or removed).

## Difference between XML and HTML
| XML                               | HTML                           |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------|
|HTML tags are predefined tags.     | XML tags are user defined tags.|
|HTML is not Case sensitive.        | 	XML is Case sensitive.       |
|HTML tags are used for displaying the data.|XML tags are used for describing the data not for displaying |
|HTML document size is relatively small.|XML document size is relatively large as the approach of formatting|

## Example File:
``` <bookstore>
  <book>
    <title>Everyday Italian</title>
    <author>Giada De Laurentiis</author>
    <year>2005</year>
    <price>30.00</price>
  </book>
  <book2>
    <title>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</title>
    <author>J. K. Rowling</author>
    <year>2000</year>
    <price>30.00</price>
  </book2>
</CATALOG>
```

## Uses of XML:

+ **Used in XML AJAX:** AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.  *AJAX applications might use XML to transport data*

+ **Used in XPath:** XPath stands for XML Path Language. XPath uses path expressions to select nodes or node-sets in an XML document. These path expressions look very much like the path expressions you use with traditional computer file systems.

+ **Used in XSL:** XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) is a styling language for XML.

+ **Used in XQuery:** XQuery is a language for finding and extracting elements and attributes from XML documents. XQuery is to XML what SQL is to databases.
